# [OCLP-Plus Tahoe Patch Set](https://github.com/YBronst/OCLP-Plus/releases)

**Based on the lzhoang2801 Tahoe patchset and optimized for macOS 26.x builds.**
</div>

## 🌟 Key Features

### 🏔️ Full macOS Tahoe Support
Complete root patching support for **macOS Tahoe 26.0 (25A5316i)** through **macOS 26.4 (25E5233c)** and beyond. This fork ensures that legacy hardware remains compatible with the latest Darwin 25 kernel.

### 📶 Wireless & Continuity Restoration
Restores full functionality for Broadcom-based wireless chipsets (BCM4360 and similar):
*  **Wi-Fi:** Stable connectivity on 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands.
*  **AirDrop & Handoff:** Fully synchronized frameworks to ensure seamless file sharing and continuity features between devices.
*  **AirPlay:** Restored support for streaming to and from your Mac.

### 🔊 Modern Audio (AppleHDA Restoration)
Starting with macOS Tahoe Beta 2, Apple removed the legacy `AppleHDA.kext`. This patch set brings it back, ensuring built-in audio works on supported legacy systems.
*  **Manual Toggle:** A new "Modern Audio" toggle in the Root Patches menu allows you to enable or disable this restoration manually.
*  **KDK Integration:** Automatically handles the necessary Kernel Debug Kit (KDK) requirements for audio driver linking.

### 🛠️ macOS 26.4 Compatibility Fixes
*  **APFS-Only Environment:** Adapted the patching logic to handle the removal of HFS+ in macOS 26.4. The patcher now utilizes APFS for all internal resource mounting and operations.
>  **Elevated hdiutil Permissions:** Fixed a critical issue where macOS 26.4 disallowed mounting disk images without root privileges.
>
> The patcher now correctly escalates via the Privileged Helper Tool.

## ⚠️ Important Technical Notes

### 🔑 AMFI & Security

*  **AMFI Alert:** To successfully bypass Apple Mobile file integrity checks, you must use either AMFIPass.kext with the `-amfipassbeta` boot argument or `amfi=0x80`. You can also use both together.
*  **Note:**  If third-party browsers (e.g., Firefox) or camera/mic permissions fail while using `amfi=0x80`, try adding the `ipc_control_port_options=0` parameter to your boot arguments.
*  **SIP Requirements:** System Integrity Protection must be set properly.
*  **Typical Value:** (CSR_ALLOW_UNTRUSTED_KEXTS | CSR_ALLOW_UNRESTRICTED_FS).
*  **OpenCore config.plist:** NVRAM > Add > 7C436110-AB2A-4BBB-A880-FE41995C9F82 > csr-active-config (data) <03080000>.
*  **Clover config.plist:** Set RtVariables > CsrActiveConfig (string) 0x803.
*  **Secure Boot Model:** To allow root patching for Wi-Fi and other drivers, Apple Secure Boot must be disabled.
*  **OpenCore:** Set Misc > Security > SecureBootModel to Disabled.
>
>  **Clover:** Ensure RtVariables > HWTarget is NOT set (must be empty) or commented out (e.g., HWTarget?) to keep Apple Secure Boot inactive.

### 🔄 Apply Changes: Reset NVRAM
> To ensure these new security settings (SIP, AMFI, and Secure Boot) take effect, you MUST perform a Reset NVRAM after saving your config.plist.
> OpenCore: Select "Reset NVRAM" from the boot picker menu (or press Space if it's hidden).
> Clover: Press F11 at the boot screen to clear NVRAM and restart.

### ⚒️ [Build and run from source](https://github.com/YBronst/OCLP-Plus/blob/main/SOURCE.md)

### 💾 Installation Requirements
💡  **Before Running Post-Install Patches:**
* **KDK is mandatory:** For macOS 13 through Tahoe (26.x), the Kernel Debug Kit must be installed for drivers like AppleHDA to link correctly. Use the Help > Download KDK button.

⚠️ **Resource Dependency Notice**
* **Patcher Resources:** This version relies on the [YBronst PatcherSupportPkg](https://github.com/YBronst/PatcherSupportPkg) for native Tahoe binaries.
> **Important:** Please be aware that if this resource becomes unavailable for any reason (e.g., server downtime or repository removal),
> the OCLP-3.1.7 Tahoe Patch Set will lose its ability to fetch the necessary binaries, and root patching will fail.

# OpenCore Legacy Patcher 3.1.5 - Tahoe Patch Set (YBronst)

This project continues the Tahoe patch set based on commit `lzhoang2801` from December 24, 2025, and adapts it to the new macOS Tahoe environment.

## Important Compatibility Notice

This repository supports:
* **macOS Tahoe 26.0 – 26.3**
* **Support for macOS Tahoe 26.4 and later** will be implemented as soon as possible

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Starting with macOS 26.4 beta 1, Apple made significant changes to the system update process. The previous Tahoe update process cannot function without modifications in these versions.

### In particular:
* Previous handling of **HFS-based patch images** is no longer accepted by the OS.
* Mounting images via [`hdiutil`](https://github.com/YBronst/tccplus) now requires **elevated privileges** and cannot be executed in a normal user context. Because of this, the original OCLP 3.0.0 Nightly workflow cannot complete the root patch installation process on macOS 26.4 without modification.

## Key Changes in 3.1.5
* **Backward compatibility** with macOS Tahoe 26.0 – 26.3 is maintained.
* **Patch image processing** has been migrated to APFS for compatibility with macOS 26.4.
* **Privileged mount logic** has been added, which is necessary for accessing internal patch images and system resources.
* **AMFIPass** cannot be used with OCLP 3.1.5 due to a persistent kernel panic. Instead, use `amfi=0x80` boot argument and handling application permissions based on [`tccplus`](https://github.com/YBronst/tccplus).

## Modern Audio (AppleHDA)
On macOS 26.4 beta 1, installing the Modern Audio patch is temporarily **not recommended** until the corresponding kernel debug kit (KDK) becomes available.

For systems requiring a fully functional reference environment (including sound) on macOS 26.3 and earlier, I recommend a saved and working patch snapshot from December 24th, available here: [`OCLP-lzhoang2801`](https://github.com/kgp-macPro/OCLP-lzhoang2801)

*Note: This patch set still requires the `amfi=0x80` boot argument.*

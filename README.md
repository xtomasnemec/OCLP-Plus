# <img src="https://github.com/YBronst/OCLP-YBronst/blob/main/docs/images/OC-Patcher.png" width="48" align="center"> [OCLP-3.1.7 Tahoe Patch Set by YBronst](https://github.com/YBronst/OCLP-YBronst/releases)

**Based on the lzhoang2801 Tahoe patchset and optimized for macOS 26.x builds.**

## 🌟 Key Features

### 🏔️ Full macOS Tahoe Support
Complete root patching support for **macOS Tahoe 26.0 (25A5316i)** through **macOS 26.4 (25E5233c)** and beyond. This fork ensures that legacy hardware remains compatible with the latest Darwin 25 kernel.

### 📶 Wireless & Continuity Restoration
Restores full functionality for Broadcom-based wireless chipsets (BCM4360 and similar):
*   **Wi-Fi:** Stable connectivity on 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands.
*   **AirDrop & Handoff:** Fully synchronized frameworks to ensure seamless file sharing and continuity features between devices.
*   **AirPlay:** Restored support for streaming to and from your Mac.

### 🔊 Modern Audio (AppleHDA Restoration)
Starting with macOS Tahoe Beta 2, Apple removed the legacy `AppleHDA.kext`. This patch set brings it back, ensuring built-in audio works on supported legacy systems.
*   **Manual Toggle:** A new "Modern Audio" toggle in the Root Patches menu allows you to enable or disable this restoration manually.
*   **KDK Integration:** Automatically handles the necessary Kernel Debug Kit (KDK) requirements for audio driver linking.

### 🛠️ macOS 26.4 Compatibility Fixes
*   **APFS-Only Environment:** Adapted the patching logic to handle the removal of HFS+ in macOS 26.4. The patcher now utilizes APFS for all internal resource mounting and operations.
*   **Elevated hdiutil Permissions:** Fixed a critical issue where macOS 26.4 disallowed mounting disk images without root privileges. The patcher now correctly escalates via the Privileged Helper Tool.

## ⚠️ Important Technical Notes

### 🔑 AMFI & Security

*   **AMFIPass Alert:** Do **NOT** use `AMFIPass.kext` standalone. In macOS Tahoe, this version causes persistent kernel panics during boot.
*   **Solution:** You must use `AMFIPass.kext` (v1.4.1 or later) in combination with the boot argument amfi=0x80 to successfully bypass Apple Mobile File Integrity checks.
*   **Note:** If you experience issues with third-party browsers (like Firefox) or camera/mic permissions, consider adding `ipc_control_port_options=0` to your boot-args as well.
*   **SIP Requirements:** System Integrity Protection must be set properly.
*   **Typical Value:** (CSR_ALLOW_UNTRUSTED_KEXTS | CSR_ALLOW_UNRESTRICTED_FS).
*   **OpenCore config.plist:** NVRAM > Add > 7C436110-AB2A-4BBB-A880-FE41995C9F82 > csr-active-config <Data> <03080000>.
*   **Clover config.plist:** Set RtVariables > CsrActiveConfig <string> 0x803.
*   **Secure Boot Model:** To allow root patching for Wi-Fi and other drivers, Apple Secure Boot must be disabled.
>   **OpenCore:** Set Misc > Security > SecureBootModel to Disabled.
>
>   **Clover:** Ensure RtVariables > HWTarget is NOT set (must be empty) or commented out (e.g., HWTarget?) to keep Apple Secure Boot inactive.

### 🔄 Apply Changes: Reset NVRAM
> To ensure these new security settings (SIP, AMFI, and Secure Boot) take effect, you MUST perform a Reset NVRAM after saving your config.plist.
> OpenCore: Select "Reset NVRAM" from the boot picker menu (or press Space if it's hidden).
> Clover: Press F11 at the boot screen to clear NVRAM and restart.

### ⚒️ [Build and run from source](https://github.com/YBronst/OCLP-YBronst/blob/main/SOURCE.md)

### 💾 Installation Requirements
*   **Kernel Debug Kit (KDK):** Required for most root patches on macOS 13+. Use the new **"Download KDK"** button in the Help menu to fetch the latest version.
*   **Patcher Resources:** This version relies on the [YBronst PatcherSupportPkg](https://github.com/YBronst/PatcherSupportPkg) for native Tahoe binaries.

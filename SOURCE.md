# Build and run from source

OCLP-Plus at its core is a Python-based GUI/CLI-based application. In turn, to run the project from source, you simply need to invoke the OCLP-Plus-GUI.command file via Python.

* **Warning**: Nightly builds (untagged builds built from the latest commit) are actively developed OCLP-Plus builds. These builds have not been tested, are not guaranteed to work, and are not guaranteed to be safe. Do not use nightlies without a good reason to do so, and do not use them on your main machine. Additionally, these binaries should not be used without first consulting the [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md).

  **Do not share _any_ links to these binaries** in forums; please link to **this document only**.
  * Additionally, do not reupload these binaries or download binaries from other sites. Using binaries from untrusted sources is a security issue, as they may have been tampered with.
* Users running new builds of the project without understanding what has changed and the implications of installing software under active development are at a higher risk of bricking their installation as they do not read any warnings provided in the CHANGELOG. We wish to minimize these situations as much as possible.

## Getting Started

To start, ensure you have Python 3.6 or newer installed. Additionally, ensure that it was downloaded from the official source, [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/).

* Python installations either preinstalled or provided with Xcode or the Xcode Command Line Tools are unsupported due to reliability issues.

Once Python is installed, open Terminal and run the following:

```sh
# Move into a directory to store the project
cd ~/Developer
# Clone project
git https://github.com/xtomasnemec/OCLP-Plus.git
# Move into Project directory
cd ./OCLP-Plus
# Install Python dependencies used by the project
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

If you have any installation errors, see the following troubleshooting options:

* Use Python 3.11
  * Our build server currently uses Python 3.11 for generating binaries used in releases
* Use .whl snapshots for installing additional dependencies

## Running OCLP-Plus

To run the project from source, simply invoke via python3:

```sh
# Launch GUI
python3 OCLP-Plus-GUI.command
```

Note that the OCLP-Plus-GUI.command file can be run as both a GUI and a CLI utility for other programs to call. If no core arguments are passed, the GUI is initialized. Otherwise the CLI will start:

```sh
# Launch CLI
python3 OCLP-Plus-GUI.command --build --model iMac12,2 --verbose
```

Pass `-h` or `--help` for more information on supported CLI arguments.

## Generating prebuilt binaries

The main goal of generating prebuilt binaries is to strip the requirement of a local Python installation for users. For developers, there's very little benefit besides enabling dark mode support in the GUI. For development, simply use the OCLP-Plus-GUI.command file with a Python 3 installation.

```sh
# Install PyInstaller
pip3 install pyinstaller
# Move into project directory
cd ~/Developer/OCLP-Plus/
# Create the pyinstaller based Application
python3 Build-Project.command
# Open build folder
open ./dist/
```

Once done, you'll find the application generated at `./dist/OCLP-Plus.app`:
